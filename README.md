# Machine Learning Playgrounds

## About
The Machine Learning Playgrounds is a project developed with the purpose of practicing Dashboard development using Plotly Dash for python, as well as machine learning concepts and implementation using scikit-learn. This application is able to show how ML algorithms deal with different kinds of datasets, and how parameter tuning can affect a ML model.

## Features
- Machine Learning algorithms:
    - [x] Nearest Neighbors
    - [x] Support Vector Machine
    - [x] Decision Tree
    - [ ] Neural Network
    
- Types of datasets:
    - [x] Blobs
    - [x] Circles
    - [x] Moon
